## Operation

### Getting started

1. In the Dashboard, click **Create Project +**

   You can add other frameworks from this page if you want to create a monorepo application, eg, Next.js + Bun for backend.
3. In **Pick Add-ons**, select any databases or extra tools you need.
4. Choose **Create Repository** so Diploi generates a new GitHub repo for your project.
5. Click **Launch Stack**

### Development

Will run `npm install` when component is first initialized, and `npm run dev` when deployment is started.

### Production

Will build a production ready image. Image runs `npm install` & `npm build` when being created. Once the image runs, `npm start` is called.
